    /* Inlets and outlets take three arguments inside the curly braces
    - An owner object (typically this)
    - A description
    - A type (as a string).

    mindev::inlet<>  input /*inlet 1*/ {this, "(bang) say hi", "bang"};
    mindev::outlet<> greeting_out		    { this, "Message for a person", "bang" };
    mindev::outlet<> dayout{ this, "Get the day out", "today"};

    /* Messages are the most basic functional unit. They take four arguments
    - An owner object (typically this)
    - A type (as a string)
    - A description
    - A function (typically MIN_FUNCTION)
    See documentation for information on MIN_FUNCTION 
    
    Write your functionality within the MIN_FUNCTION curly braces. An important thing to remember about 
    messages is that only one message of each type should be included. You could include the following 
    messages:
    
    message<> msg1 {this, "int", "message1", some_function};
    message<> msg2 {this, "float", "message2", another_function};
    message<> msg3 {this, "bang", "message3", yet_another_function};
    
    The important notes here are that the first message triggers when an inlet receives an int, the second a
    float, and the third a bang. Use a switch statement to decide what to do based on what inlet the
    information came from as demonstrated below. Also note how to send data to the outlets. Note that the
    switch statements here are a bit overkill since the inlets take specific types. They would be more 
    necessary if, for example, there were two inlets that accepted integers. */
